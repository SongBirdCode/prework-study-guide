# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide gives a visual result of work in utilizing HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript for the purpose to learn and grow healthy basic software engineering techniques. This project was built through navigating these languages and to better learn how each language works together to make this final result. It solves the question of the unknown as well as solidifies the action that coding is not impossible for those hungry enough to problem solve. I learned to treat obstacles as opportunities and to not fear mistakes, the importance of breaks and time management, and excited to grow from here on.

## Usage


This Prework Study Guide can be used to revisit notes within HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. It can also be used to navigate and practice through DevTools console to inspect JavaScript performance. Revisiting and adding new notes, and the basis of completing this project gives hope as more challenges present themselves through future projects. I made it this far to complete this project, I can only grow from here towards brighter, more complex projects to look forward to. This project will continue to remind me during more intense work and projects that I can indeed problem solve and no task is impossible.
